                the ``feed()`` method.  It should only be called when using the feed

                Feeds data to the parser.  The argument should be an 8-bit string
                buffer containing encoded data, although Unicode is supported as long
                as both string types are not mixed.
        
                This is the main entry point to the consumer interface of a
                parser.  The parser will parse as much of the XML stream as it
                can on each call.  To finish parsing or to reset the parser,
                call the ``close()`` method.  Both methods may raise
                ParseError if errors occur in the input data.  If an error is
                raised, there is no longer a need to call ``close()``.
        
                The feed parser interface is independent of the normal parser
                usage.  You can use the same parser as a feed parser and in
                the ``parse()`` function concurrently.
