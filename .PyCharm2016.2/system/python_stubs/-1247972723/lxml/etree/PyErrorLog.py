    PyErrorLog(self, logger_name=None, logger=None)
        A global error log that connects to the Python stdlib logging package.
    
        The constructor accepts an optional logger name or a readily
        instantiated logger instance.
    
        If you want to change the mapping between libxml2's ErrorLevels and Python
        logging levels, you can modify the level_map dictionary from a subclass.
    
        The default mapping is::
    
                ErrorLevels.WARNING = logging.WARNING
                ErrorLevels.ERROR   = logging.ERROR
                ErrorLevels.FATAL   = logging.CRITICAL
    
        You can also override the method ``receive()`` that takes a LogEntry
        object and calls ``self.log(log_entry, format_string, arg1, arg2, ...)``
        with appropriate data.
    """

        log(self, log_entry, message, *args)
        
                Called by the .receive() method to log a _LogEntry instance to
                the Python logging system.  This handles the error level
                mapping.
        
                In the default implementation, the ``message`` argument
                receives a complete log line, and there are no further
                ``args``.  To change the message format, it is best to
                override the .receive() method instead of this one.
