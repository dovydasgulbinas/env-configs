from dict import dict

class Dictionary(dict):
    """
    An mapping whose keys are similar and whose values are similar,
    implemented as a subtype of dict.
    
    As currently implemented, a Dictionary behaves just like a dict, but
    with the addition of a ``signature`` property set by the constructor;
    conversion of its items to D-Bus types is only done when it's sent in
    a Message. This may change in future so validation is done earlier.
    
    Constructor::
    
        Dictionary(mapping_or_iterable=(), signature=None, variant_level=0)
    
    ``variant_level`` must be non-negative; the default is 0.
    
    ``signature`` is either a string or None. If a string, it must consist
    of exactly two complete type signatures, representing the 'key' type
    (which must be a primitive type, i.e. one of "bdginoqstuxy")
    and the 'value' type. The signature of the whole Dictionary will be
    ``a{xx}`` where ``xx`` is replaced by the given signature.
    
    If it is None (the default), when the Dictionary is sent over
    D-Bus, the key and value signatures will be guessed from an arbitrary
    element of the Dictionary.
    
    :IVariables:
      `variant_level` : int
        Indicates how many nested Variant containers this object
        is contained in: if a message's wire format has a variant containing a
        variant containing an array of DICT_ENTRY, this is represented in
        Python by a Dictionary with variant_level==2.
