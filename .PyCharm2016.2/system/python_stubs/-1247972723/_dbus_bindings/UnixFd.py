Low-level Python bindings for libdbus. Don't use this module directly -

    ``value`` must be the integer value of a file descriptor, or an object that
    implements the fileno() method. Otherwise, `ValueError` will be
    raised.
    
    UnixFd keeps a dup() (duplicate) of the supplied file descriptor. The
    caller remains responsible for closing the original fd.
    
    ``variant_level`` must be non-negative; the default is 0.

        is contained in: if a message's wire format has a variant containing a
        variant containing an Unix Fd, this is represented in Python by an
        Unix Fd with variant_level==2.
