Low-level Python bindings for libdbus. Don't use this module directly -
the public API is provided by the `dbus`, `dbus.service`, `dbus.mainloop`

class Array(list):
    """
    An array of similar items, implemented as a subtype of list.
    
    As currently implemented, an Array behaves just like a list, but
    with the addition of a ``signature`` property set by the constructor;
    conversion of its items to D-Bus types is only done when it's sent in
    a Message. This might change in future so validation is done earlier.
    
    Constructor::
    
        dbus.Array([iterable][, signature][, variant_level])
    
    ``variant_level`` must be non-negative; the default is 0.
    
    ``signature`` is the D-Bus signature string for a single element of the
    array, or None. If not None it must represent a single complete type, the
    type of a single array item; the signature of the whole Array may be
    obtained by prepending ``a`` to the given signature.
    
    If None (the default), when the Array is sent over
    D-Bus, the item signature will be guessed from the first element.
    
    :IVariables:
      `variant_level` : int
        Indicates how many nested Variant containers this object
        is contained in: if a message's wire format has a variant containing a
        variant containing an array, this is represented in Python by an
        Array with variant_level==2.
