    PythonElementClassLookup(self, fallback=None)
        Element class lookup based on a subclass method.
    
        This class lookup scheme allows access to the entire XML tree in
        read-only mode.  To use it, re-implement the ``lookup(self, doc,
        root)`` method in a subclass::
    
            from lxml import etree, pyclasslookup
    
            class MyElementClass(etree.ElementBase):
                honkey = True
    
            class MyLookup(pyclasslookup.PythonElementClassLookup):
                def lookup(self, doc, root):
                    if root.tag == "sometag":
                        return MyElementClass
                    else:
                        for child in root:
                            if child.tag == "someothertag":
                                return MyElementClass
                    # delegate to default
                    return None
    
        If you return None from this method, the fallback will be called.
    
        The first argument is the opaque document instance that contains
        the Element.  The second argument is a lightweight Element proxy
        implementation that is only valid during the lookup.  Do not try
        to keep a reference to it.  Once the lookup is done, the proxy
        will be invalid.
    
        Also, you cannot wrap such a read-only Element in an ElementTree,
        and you must take care not to keep a reference to them outside of
        the `lookup()` method.
    
        Note that the API of the Element objects is not complete.  It is
        purely read-only and does not support all features of the normal
        `lxml.etree` API (such as XPath, extended slicing or some
        iteration methods).
