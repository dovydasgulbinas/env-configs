    ElementDepthFirstIterator(self, node, tag=None, inclusive=True)
        Iterates over an element and its sub-elements in document order (depth
        first pre-order).
    
        Note that this also includes comments, entities and processing
        instructions.  To filter them out, check if the ``tag`` property
        of the returned element is a string (i.e. not None and not a
        factory function), or pass the ``Element`` factory for the ``tag``
        argument to receive only Elements.
    
        If the optional ``tag`` argument is not None, the iterator returns only
        the elements that match the respective name and namespace.
    
        The optional boolean argument 'inclusive' defaults to True and can be set
        to False to exclude the start element itself.
    
        Note that the behaviour of this iterator is completely undefined if the
        tree it traverses is modified during iteration.
